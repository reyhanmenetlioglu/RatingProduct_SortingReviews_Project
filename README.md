##### RatingProduct & SortingReviewsin in Amazon

##### Business Problem:
One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points given to the products after sales.
The solution to this problem is to provide greater customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, to make the product stand out for the sellers, and to provide a seamless shopping experience for the buyers.

Another problem is whether the comments made on the products are listed correctly or not.
The prominence of misleading comments will cause both financial loss and loss of customers, as it will directly affect the sale of the product.

As a result of solving these 2 basic problems, e-commerce site and sellers will increase their sales, while customers will complete their purchasing journey without any problems.
